A Snowflake ID generator is a system designed to generate unique, time-ordered 64-bit IDs at high scale across distributed systems without coordination between nodes. It was originally developed by Twitter for its internal infrastructure to uniquely identify tweets, users, etc.

## Structure of a Snowflake ID (Twitter's Original Design)

A typical Snowflake ID is a 64-bit integer composed of several parts:

Bit Length |	Field      |	Description
-----------|---------------|-------------------------------
1 bit      |	Sign bit   |	Always 0 (positive number).
41 bits    |	Timestamp  |	Milliseconds since a custom epoch (Twitter used Nov 4, 2010).
10 bits    |	Machine ID |	Identifies the worker/machine (5 bits for datacenter + 5 for worker node).
12 bits    |	Sequence number |	Counter within the same millisecond.

## Example:

* Timestamp: 41 bits allows tracking time for ~69 years.
* Sequence: 12 bits allows 4096 IDs per millisecond per machine.
* Machine ID: 10 bits allows 1024 unique nodes.

## Key Benefits:

* Globally unique without central coordination.
* Roughly time-ordered, enabling chronological sorting.
* Efficient (just integer arithmetic and bit shifts).
* Scalable (supports thousands of nodes and millions of IDs/sec).

## Use Cases:

* Generating IDs for distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
* Event ordering in systems like Kafka.
* Any system requiring scalable and time-sortable unique identifiers.
